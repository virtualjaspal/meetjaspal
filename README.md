# Jaspal's Portfolio (GitHub Pages)

A clean, single‑repo portfolio you can publish with GitHub Pages.

## Quick start

1. Create a new public repo named **virtualjaspal.github.io** on GitHub.
2. Upload these files (or push via Git).
3. In the repo, go to **Settings → Pages** and ensure the **Source** is set to **Deploy from a branch** and **Branch: `main` / root**.
4. Visit `https://virtualjaspal.github.io` after a minute.

### Local edits

You can edit `index.html` for content, `assets/css/styles.css` for theme, and `assets/js/main.js` for interactions. Replace placeholder images in `assets/img/` and add your resume PDF at `assets/Jaspal_Saran_Resume.pdf`.

### Customizing

- Update the Open Graph image at `assets/img/og-cover.jpg` and the favicon `assets/img/favicon.png`.
- Replace `virtualjaspal` in `index.html` with your username.
- Optional: Set up a custom domain in **Settings → Pages**.
- Forms: The contact form is compatible with Netlify (no backend needed). If hosting purely on GitHub Pages, you can swap it for a mailto link or connect to a form backend later.
